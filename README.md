# Basic Quiz Game

Welcome to the Basic Quiz Game project! This project is designed to provide hands-on experience in Python and reinforce your understanding of basic programming concepts.

## Project Objectives

- Build a simple quiz game that asks users a series of questions.
- Implement a scoring system to evaluate the user's performance.
- Enhance user interaction by allowing them to input their answers.
- Reinforce Python fundamentals, including data structures, control flow, and user input handling.
- Gain practical experience in structuring a small Python project.

## Project Overview
